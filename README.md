# Lesson boooking api

## Welcome!

Welcome to my lesson booking project API repository (WIP)! While the aim here is to build a booking website, I am primarily taking this as an opportunity to put my current skill set and understanding to the test, and keep on learning. 

### Things I am working on

- understanding and using TypeORM 
- implementing classes throughout the codebase, and finding opportunities to abstract 
- modularity
- single responsibility principle
- clear folder structure
- code readability
- unit VS integration testing (+ coverage)

### Currently in development

- registration and login routes
- I will also be setting up swagger documentation - link to be added soon.

## Client repository

The client repositor link will be added here soon - watch this space!
